## Lessons Learned

This project was one of the largest I have worked on, and something that will continue to be developed.  That hardest lesson here was utilizing the APIs to display the data, and how to use state management with react-router-dom, as well as useEffect with the API.  The biggest success was getting the search to work with the movie API, as it was difficult to get the movie ID to match when clicking on a specific movie.  

CSS has always been a struggle for me, but I utilized Figma to layout the look of the site before beginning the framework for it. TailwindCSS also came in handy here as it made it so much easier to inject the JSX with tailwind, keeping everything within the .jsx files instead of moving to a stylesheet and utilizing specific classes.

- React (useEffect, useState, functional components, hooks, JSX, component structure)
